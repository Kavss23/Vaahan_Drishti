In Vaahan Drishti, The model we propose to make is a kind of model that can make smart decisions to find out whether the vehicles in front of emergency vehicles like ambulances and fire brigades stuck in traffic jams had space to give way to them or not under different weather conditions, road terrains etc. If yes and they did not move, the number plates of the vehicles would be captured and logged onto the Rajasthan Police System, triggering a challan after the number plate is detected and the owner to whom the vehicle belongs to is identified.
